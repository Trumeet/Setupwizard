/**
 * Added by Trumeet@GitHub: We set standalone.gradle as default so 'Application' developer (Not platform developers) can use this library directly without set buildFileName.
 *
 * If you are building platform apps, you can include the following in your settings.gradle file:
 *      include ':setup-wizard-lib'
 *      project(':setup-wizard-lib').projectDir = new File(PATH_TO_THIS_DIRECTORY)
 *      project(':setup-wizard-lib').buildFileName = 'build-orig.gradle'
